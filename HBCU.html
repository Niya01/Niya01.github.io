					Going into college you have to have a game plan, starting with what you want major and minor in. many students enter college as undecided and that completely fine,l but if you have any idea of what kind a career you want have or what you want to major in that would make fiding the HBCU for you much simpler. After you decide whether you have some kind of career idea in mind or major in mind you will than develop a list of criteria you want to use to evaluate and weed out colleges. Ask yourself whether you want to live at home or not, Do you want to attend a large university or a small college, what are the costs? Next you will construct a possible list of possible colleges and universities you may want to attend. Once that is done you would want to gather some information about the schools you've selected to put on list of possible universities and colleges. This website could assit you in this step. Repeat step two but this time list the schools in numerical order (1 being you dream school). Once that is done it would be best if you visited the colleges and/or universities you listed.Visitng those schools is the best way to get a feel of the school. While you visiting you may want to take a tour of the school and meet with students and see how they feel about the school. For more information and advice on making the best of a college visit, visit <a href="http://www.quintcareers.com/campus_visit.html"> Quintessential Careers</a>. Next yopu should apply for the schools that made the cut. If you're wondering how many you should apply to, it depends on you your financial  situation. But you should always have a school that you're positive you can get in and can handle it may not but your first choose but itsd you  back up, your plan B. Thats always healthy to have when it comes to risky situations like getting accepted to schools. after that of course you wait
