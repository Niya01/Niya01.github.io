	    <p> Way to go Ms. Janelle Monae. You look darling. I honestly thought  I would never see you in a skirt or something that could possibly considered revealing. But you are doing a wonderful job showing yound ladies how to dress. And you also in including thing that young ladies wear all the time to day and you making it look amazing. In my opinion there's not to many people who show people of my generation how look professial and defiant. So thank you for being different and allowing you fashion to actually say something as my grandmother would say. Many people would say that you have a osuperpower that will eventually change the world. You go wonder women, you go do ur thang!</p>
